/*
An array data structure is a fundamental concept in computer science that stores a collection of elements
in a contiguous block [A set of bytes in memory that are next to each other, without any gap bytes between them]
of memory. It allows for efficient access to elements using indices and is widely used in programming for
organizing and manipulating data.

1. An array is a collection of items of the same variable type.
2. Each item in an array is indexed starting with 0.
3. Arrays are used in a wide variety of applications:
    - Storing data for processing
    - Implementing data structures such as stacks and queues
    - Representing data in tables and matrices
    - Creating dynamic data structures such as linked lists and trees
4. There are two main types of arrays:
    - One-dimensional arrays: These arrays store a single row of elements.
    - Multidimensional arrays: These arrays store multiple rows of elements.
5. Common operations performed on arrays include:
    - Traversal: Visiting each element of an array in a specific order (e.g., sequential, reverse).
    - Insertion: Adding a new element to an array at a specific index.
    - Deletion: Removing an element from an array at a specific index.
    - Searching: Finding the index of an element in an array.
6. Below are some applications of arrays
    - Storing and accessing data:
      Arrays are used to store and retrieve data in a specific order. For example, an array can be used to
      store the scores of a group of students, or the temperatures recorded by a weather station.
    - Sorting:
      Arrays can be used to sort data in ascending or descending order. Sorting algorithms such as bubble
      sort, merge sort, and quicksort rely heavily on arrays.
    - Searching:
      Arrays can be searched for specific elements using algorithms such as linear search and binary search.
    - Matrices:
      Arrays are used to represent matrices in mathematical computations such as matrix multiplication,
      linear algebra, and image processing.
    - Stacks and queues:
      Arrays are used as the underlying data structure for implementing stacks and queues, which are commonly
      used in algorithms and data structures.
    - Graphs:
      Arrays can be used to represent graphs in computer science. Each element in the array represents a node
      in the graph, and the relationships between the nodes are represented by the values stored in the array.
    - Dynamic programming:
      Dynamic programming algorithms often use arrays to store intermediate results of sub-problems in order
      to solve a larger problem.
7. Applications of Array in Java:
    - Storing collections of data:
      Arrays are often used to store collections of data of the same type. For example, an array of integers
      can be used to store a set of numerical values.
    - Implementing matrices and tables:
      Arrays can be used to implement matrices and tables. For example, a two-dimensional array can be used to
      store a matrix of numerical values.
    - Sorting and searching:
      Arrays are often used for sorting and searching data. For example, the Arrays class in Java provides
      methods like sort() and binarySearch() to sort and search elements in an array.
    - Implementing data structures:
      Arrays are used as the underlying data structure for several other data structures like stacks, queues,
      and heaps. For ex, an array-based implementation of a stack can be used to store elements in the stack.
    - Image processing:
      Arrays are commonly used to store the pixel values of an image. For example, a two-dimensional array can
      be used to store the RGB values of an image.
